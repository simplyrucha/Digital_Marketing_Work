### Website for a biotech company
link for website - http://www.teamonebiotech.com

Based on competitive analysis and other website search, I carried out a website redesign project using WordPress - updated existing pages layout, created new pages. I also worked on selection of relevant images to enhance the website's aesthetics from own search or collection provided by the client. One primary objective of the project was also to work on new product display using plugins. I also performed keyword search and based on that I worked on image alt tags, meta tags & descriptions and page content (for all pages) under SEO process. 

### Website for Salon & Academy

I conceptualized and designed the primary format for stylet.org, a beauty salon and academy website that showcases its services and courses. I created a clean and modern layout with easy navigation, highlighting the latest trends in beauty services and industry education. My design also emphasizes high-quality images to provide a visually engaging experience for potential clients and students. I worked on WordPress for this project.
